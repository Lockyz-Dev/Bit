# Test Plugin
## What is Test Plugin?
Test Plugin was created to allow us to test Bit: Cores new plugin system. It can also serve as a "template" so to speak of a Bit: Core Plugin.

## What is required for a Bit: Core Plugin?
Bit Core Plugins require at least 1 event and 1 command. In the future, the bot will look for json files displaying each plugins information and whether the plugin contains commands or events.

## Why Plugins?
Aside from being able to drag/drop plugin folders directly into the bot, eventually the bot will be able to retroactively load new commands and events when new plugins are added, though for now it requires a bot restart.
